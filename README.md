* **One-Dimensional Cellular Automata** This sketch generates 256 representations of all possible rulesets of one-dimensional cellular automata. - [Video](https://vimeo.com/114766075)

	The cellular automata represented share these features:
	1. The grid of a single generation is toroidal.
	2. The state of every cell can be 0 (white) or 1 (black).
	3. One cell has two neighbours, the one on its left and the one on its right (according to the first feature).
